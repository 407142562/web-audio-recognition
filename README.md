Web based audio recognition
===

This is an example implementation of local, in-browser audio command recognition
using web technologies. The code is split up into three parts:

- Audio feature extraction: [/audio-features](tree/master/audio-features)
- Training a neural network: [/train-model](tree/master/train-model)
- Running inference on live audio input: [/inference-demo](tree/master/inference-demo)

Note: this is not an officially supported Google product.
