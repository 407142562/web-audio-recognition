Web based audio recognition
===

This is an example implementation of local, in-browser audio command recognition
using web technologies. The code is split up into three parts:

- Audio feature extraction: [/audio-features](audio-features)
- Training a neural network: [/train-model](train-model)
- Running inference on live audio input: [/inference-demo](inference-demo)
